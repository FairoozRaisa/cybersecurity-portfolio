# Project — Network Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

## Objective
To identify live hosts, open ports, and exposed services in a controlled lab network environment and interpret results from a security perspective.

## Environment
- Scope: Local lab network (authorized testing only)
- Tool: Nmap
- OS: Windows / Linux (lab setup)

## Methodology
1. **Host Discovery**
   - Identified active hosts on the network to define the scan scope.
2. **Port Scanning**
   - Scanned common ports to detect exposed services.
3. **Service Enumeration**
   - Identified services and versions where possible.
4. **Basic Risk Interpretation**
   - Interpreted how open services increase attack surface and what basic mitigations may reduce risk.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understood how attackers perform reconnaissance and how defenders can reduce exposure.
- Learned to read scan output and map open ports to likely services.
- Improved ability to explain findings clearly.

## Outcome
Created a repeatable scanning workflow and improved awareness of network exposure and basic mitigation (e.g., close unused ports, restrict access, update services).

## Evidence
Screenshots / outputs can be added here (optional) in the future.
