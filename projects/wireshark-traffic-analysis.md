# Project — Packet Analysis with Wireshark (TCP/UDP/DNS/HTTP)

## Objective
To capture and interpret network traffic in order to understand real protocol behavior and improve troubleshooting and security analysis skills.

## Environment
- Tool: Wireshark
- Traffic Types: TCP handshake, DNS queries/responses, HTTP/HTTPS basics
- Scope: Lab captures (authorized)

## Methodology
1. **Packet Capture**
   - Captured network traffic during controlled activities (browsing, DNS resolution, and connections).
2. **Filtering & Inspection**
   - Used filters to isolate relevant packets and protocols.
3. **Protocol Analysis**
   - Observed TCP 3-way handshake
   - Identified UDP-based DNS queries and responses
   - Examined HTTP requests/responses and encrypted HTTPS patterns
4. **Interpretation**
   - Mapped packet fields to protocol behavior and identified normal patterns.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Improved skill in reading packets and identifying protocol flows.
- Learned how DNS resolution appears in real traffic.
- Strengthened troubleshooting approach using evidence from packets.

## Outcome
Built confidence in packet-level analysis and developed a structured workflow for capture → filter → interpret → report.

## Evidence
PCAPs or screenshots can be added here later (optional).
